# The syntax for creating new binary operators in R is unlike anything else in
# R, but it allows you to define a new syntax for your function. I would only
# recommend making your own binary operator if you plan on using it often!
#
# User-defined binary operators have the following syntax:
#      %[whatever]% 
# where [whatever] represents any valid variable name.
# 
# Let's say I wanted to define a binary operator that multiplied two numbers and
# then added one to the product. An implementation of that operator is below:
#
# "%mult_add_one%" <- function(left, right){ # Notice the quotation marks!
#   left * right + 1
# }
#
# I could then use this binary operator like `4 %mult_add_one% 5` which would
# evaluate to 21.
#
# Write your own binary operator below from absolute scratch! Your binary
# operator must be called %p% so that the expression:
#
#       "Good" %p% "job!"
#
# will evaluate to: "Good job!"

"%p%" <- function(l,r){ # Remember to add arguments!
  paste(l,r)
}


### THE RESULT OF THIS FUNCTION IS THE FOLLOWING
> "I" %p% "love" %p% "R!"
[1] "I love R!"
### I don't have to include speech marks at the beginning or end of my binary operator calculation because it is this: a binary operation
### I just want my %p% to do something, as if it were & or |
